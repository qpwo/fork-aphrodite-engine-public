- A `passthrough` will come in on either SamplingParams or PoolingParams.
- The goal is to pass it around and get it all the way to `model_executable(**execute_model_kwargs)`.
- So we need to get `passthrough` onto `ModelInputForXPU`, the open vino thing, `ModelInputForGPU`, `ModelInputForNeuron`, and `ModelInputForTPU`.
- I only implemented distributed stuff for GPU I think.
- A function has access to the `passthrough` if it gets SamplingParams or PoolingParams or LLMInputs or EncoderDecoderLLMInputs.
- I think `passthrough' travels between GPUs and nodes/machines along ModelInputForGPUBuilder.InterDataForSeqGroup?
- Not sure this is how you're supposed to do all this.
- Seems to work for me.
